# PointingGestures
This repository includes the python script for object detection using pointing gestures. For set of defined pointing gestures, the algorithm figures out the pointing direction and detects the object in that direction, if any.

Google's Media Pipe Library is used to get the skeleton of hand. This library allows to access the points in the skeleton and then by utilizing these indices, further alogirthm is designed. For more information on Media Pipe library, plesae visit https://google.github.io/mediapipe/

Other required libraries are:
OpenCV, Time, numpy
